### Project Description

- Project built using specified UI.
- Implemented Custom Hooks to keep the logic aside from the Components and Screens. These Hooks were used to manage the Movie Search and the Movie Fetching from the API.
- Used Custom Components to keep every aspect of the project modular and scalable.
- Axios Client Object to manage every API Request and for passing the header configuration.
- Every Movie is displayed in the Home Screen grouped by Categories.
- Movie Search using a Custom Hook that receives a search term and makes an API Request every time the search term is changed.
- BONUS: Using state management with Context API for adding movies to a WatchList screen. The movie screen allows us to add a movie to our WatchList and we can remove it by pressing the "Remove from watchlist" button in the WatchList Tab.
